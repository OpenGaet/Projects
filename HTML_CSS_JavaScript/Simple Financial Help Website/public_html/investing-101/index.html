    <h1>How to Invest</h1>
    
    <p>Investing in the stock market can be very easy and very hard. It all depends on how involved you want to get. The hard way is becoming a day trader. This is someone who tracks stock price changes by the second, multiple trades throughout the day to try and buy low and sell higher for a profit. On the other hand, the easiest way I know is opening up a Robinhood account. Robinhood is an investing app that makes it free and easy to open an account and start trading stocks. With this method, however, day trading is not encouraged. The easiest, and most of the time smartest, thing to do is buy shares in an index fund whenever you have the money and hold onto it until you retire and need to start withdrawing money.</p>
    <p>Index funds are the most reliable thing you can buy, as they represent the whole of the stock market. Buying them is basically buying the U.S. economy. An index fund is made up of stocks from the top companies in the U.S. You can scroll through a list of the top 10 stocks in the U.S. below. The prices are the company stock price as of 05/28/18.</p>
