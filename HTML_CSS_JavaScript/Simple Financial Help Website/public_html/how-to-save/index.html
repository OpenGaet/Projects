    <h1>How to Save for Retirement</h1>

    <h2>Retirement Plans</h2>
      <h3>401(k)</h3>
      	<p>According to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp">Investopedia</a>,</p>
      	<blockquote>"A 401(k) plan is a qualified employer-sponsored retirement plan that eligible employees may make tax-deferred contributions from their salary or wages to on a post-tax and/or pretax basis. Employers offering a 401(k) plan may make matching or non-elective contributions to the plan on behalf of eligible employees and may also add a profit-sharing feature to the plan. Earnings in a 401(k) plan accrue on a tax-deferred basis."</blockquote>
      	<p>The employer contribution should always be maxed out. Whether or not you should max out your contribution is a different question, however. Even thought these accounts are tax-deferred, there may be other investment options that have a better return.</p>
      <h3>IRA</h3>
        <p>Also according to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traditionalira.asp">Investopedia</a>,</p>
        <blockquote>"A traditional IRA (individual retirement account) allows individuals to direct pretax income toward investments that can grow tax-deferred. The IRS assess no capital gains or dividend income taxes until the beneficiary makes a withdrawal. Individual taxpayers can contribute 100 % of any earned compensation up to a specified maximum dollar amount. Income thresholds may also apply. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible depending on the taxpayer's income, tax-filing status and other factors."</blockquote>
      	<p>As you can see, the two plans are very similar. The difference is that the IRA is a personal account, meaning you choose the investment. The contribution limits for each plan are different as well.</p>
      <h3>What is ROTH?</h3>
      	<p>ROTH is a variant of both 401(k)s and IRAs. The main difference is that instead of being able to subtract your contribution from income before being taxed on it, you are instead taxed upfront. However, when you withdraw the money in the future, you don't have to pay income tax on it. There have been many studies about which is better, but, really, it depends on many factors. The most important of these factors is the tax bracket you are in when you contribute to the account versus when you withdraw from the account. If you think you will be in a higher tax bracket when you retire, a ROTH account would be the better choice.</p>
